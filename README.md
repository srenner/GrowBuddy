# GrowBuddy
Bridging ESP32 IoT indoor gardening devices with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)
- Monitor grow room temperature
- Monitor grow room humidity
- Monitor grow room air quality
- Control grow light on/off z-wave switch
- Control grow room heater on/off z-wave switch
- Send alerts when sensors are outside of target range

Logic to be split between ESP32 CircuitPython code and Home Assistant automations on a case-by-case basis.
